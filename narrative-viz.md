# Thinking Narrative Visualization

**Abstract**

An important part of a data scientist/data analyst/data journalist's role is to communicate the insights from the data. Traditional presentation formats have been slide decks, spreadsheets or a BI dashboard. Most of them are designed to be self-served. That introduces a challenge for the analyst - the story she wanted to communicate may not come across naturally.

Narrative visualisation is a way to present analyses, thought processes and insights - all in one document. 

This talk introduces narrative visualization and provides pointers on tools and best practices on how to think and design narrative visualisations.
