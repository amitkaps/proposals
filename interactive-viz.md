**Title : Building Interactive Dashboards**

**Overview**   
Crafting interactive data visualizations for the web is hard—you're stuck using proprietary tools or must become proficient in JavaScript libraries like D3. But what if creating a visualization was as easy as writing code in Python? This workshop outlines the grammar of interactive graphics and explain how to use Python libraries to build them with ease.

**Detailed Abstract**   

*“A picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a thousand pictures.”* —Ben Shneiderman   

We’ve all seen wonderful interactive data visualizations on the web (like those from the New York Times’s Upshot or FiveThirtyEight) and may want to bring similar interaction principles to our business dashboards. But crafting an interactive data visualization on the web is hard, especially if you have limited web programming background. More often than not, data scientists want to demonstrate/showcase their work as a dashboard, get approval from stakeholders before the dashboard is moved to production by front-end engineers.

This workshop explains how to use Python libraries to build them with ease. You only need to learn the grammar and principles of interactive graphics, and you can then start your own journey in crafting interactive dashboards.

**Grammar of interactive graphics: The four layers of abstraction**   

* Data layer: Data types and transformations    
* Visual layer: Variable mapping, marks, channels, scales, coordinate system, and layouts     
* Annotation layer: Titles, axes, legends, grids, references, and text       
* Interaction layer: Navigation, transition, selection, highlighting, filtering, brushing and linking, sorting, and animation      

**Python tools landscape**

**Creating a static visualization**   

* Visualizing a multidimensional dataset     
* Playing with marks, channels, color, scales, and coordinates    
* Adding labeling and annotation     

**Adding an interaction layer**   

* Adding interactive data-model manipulation    
* Exploring common interaction patterns: Select, explore, reconfigure, encode, filter, and drill-down     

**Creating an interactive data visualization**    

* Building a full interactive data dashboard 


**Additional pointers and recap**     

* Additional concepts in interaction: Scrolling, animation, and story points
