# Visualizing Time Series

> time series: a series of values of a quantity obtained at successive times, often with equal intervals between them.
    

Most of the data we encounter and generate in life are time series. Uncovering insights over time presents a number of challenges. Some of them are:

1. *Velocity*: The speed at which data is generated can vary and impacts how to represent them
2. *Size*: Is the data sparse or dense? 
3. *Time Interval*: What is the interval at which changes are happening? How to uncover insights about them?
4. *Units of representation*: Is the need to represent absolute measurement or percentage change or a customized metric?

The most important thing to understand is there is no one chart that can do justice to the above mentioned challenges. 

By the end of the talk, the attendee will be able to know how to think about time series data, understand how to visualize them and effectively uncover and communicate insights for their respective problems.
