# Recommendation Systems

In the digital world, recommendation systems play a significant role - both for the users and for the company.

For the users, a new world of options are thrown up which hitherto was tough to find. For companies, it helps drive up user engagement and satisfaction, directly impacting their bottom line.

If you've shopped on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, you would've seen options like:
"People who viewed this product also viewed..."
"Products similar to this one..."

Netflix threw up a major challenge last decade: a million dollars to anyone who can improve their recommendation system by 10%. 

In this full-day workshop, we will walk you through the various types of recommendation system. By the end of the workshop, you will have enough knowledge to build one for your problem.
