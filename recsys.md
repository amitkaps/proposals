# Recommendation Systems

> Sure. I do marathons.... on Netflix

In the digital world, recommendation systems play a significant role - both for the users and for the company/platform/sellers.

For the users, a new world of options are thrown up - that were hitherto tough to find. For companies, it helps drive up user engagement and satisfaction, directly impacting their bottom line.

If you've shopped on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, you would've seen options like:  

*"People who viewed this product also viewed..."*  
*"Products similar to this one..."*

Netflix threw up a major data science challenge last decade: a million dollars to anyone who can improve their recommendation system by 10%. 

In this full-day workshop, we will walk you through the various types of recommendation system. By the end of the workshop, you will have enough knowledge to build one for your problem.

### Outline for the workshop

    - user-based recommendation system 
    - Content-based recommendation system

**Session 2**

1. Collaborative Filtering (hands-on)
2. Matrix Factorization (hands-on)


**Session 3**

1. Content-based Recommendation System (hands-on)
2. Deep Learning in Recommendation System (theory only)

**Session 4**

1. Recommendation System in production
    - Deploying the recommendation system models
    - Measuring improvements from recommendation system
    - Improving the models based on the feedback from production
    
2. Closing thoughts and next steps


**Pre-requisites**

The workshop is approximately 50% theory and 50% hands-on. 

1. Programming knowledge and basics of Python is necessary to follow the hands-on part. 
2. No machine learning knowledge is assumed.
3. Basics of Linear Algebra will be good-to-have.

**Software requirements**

We will be doing this on cloud. Laptop with a browser is all you need for the workshop
