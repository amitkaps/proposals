# Full Stack Data Science in Production

### Overview

This workshop addresses one of the most common pain points we have come across in organizations : last-mile delivery of data science applications. The attendees would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application - data ingestion, exploration, machine learning, RESTful API and dashboard - to solve a business prediction problem and present it to their clients.

### Detailed Abstract

“Jack of all trades, master of none, though oft times better than master of one”
One of the common pain points that we have come across in organizations is the last-mile delivery of data science applications. There are two common delivery vehicles of data products – dashboards and APIs.

More often than not, machine learning practitioners find it hard to deploy their work in production and full stack developers find it hard to incorporate machine learning models in their pipeline.

To be able to successfully do a data science-driven product/application, it requires one to have a basic understanding of machine learning, server-side programming and front-end application.

In this workshop, one would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application – Starting from data ingestion, data exploration, creating a simple machine learning model, exposing the output as a RESTful API and deploying the dashboard as a web application – to solve a business problem.

Does the number of technologies to understand look overwhelming? We have experience in guiding attendees gain a leap of faith and put together a minimum-viable-product in 3 hours.

### Course Content:

We will be using Python stack for this workshop. The focus will be on breadth and getting a data-driven product completed by the end of the workshop

Data Engineering (30 min)  
1. Data Ingestion from a database    
2. Data Exploration using pandas     

Machine Learning (30 min)      
3. A simple machine learning model using scikit-learn    

Dashboard(30 min)     
4. Creating dashboard using bokeh     

Deployment and API (30 min)    
5. Creating RESTful API   
6. Integrating model output to DB   
7. Deployment on cloud

Web Application(30 min)   
8. Creating a simple application that accomplishes this end-to-end (templates will be provided to save time.)  

Advanced topics (depending on time)   
9. Model updation as more data comes in (for this workshop, batch only – no streaming)
