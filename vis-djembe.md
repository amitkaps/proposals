# Learning Djembe Visually: Creative Coding and Music

Music visualisation is not new. Winamp and iTunes have been doing it for years. But they are designed to augment the aural senses with a nice visual display. But what if we could visualise music for not only our aesthetic senses but also for learning the music. We all learn differently - aurally, symbolically, visually and kinesthetically. 

What if we could learn music visually? It would be great if we could learn the djembe not only by playing it and by listening to it, but also seeing it visually. We will have live djembe play and see if we can all learn music visually together. This is a live performance demo and what could possibly go wrong!

- Can we see sound?
- Can we see how loud it is? Can we see all parts of it?
- We can all tap to a beat. Can we find the beat and show it?
- Can we show the pattern in the beat? Boom Boom Pa!
- Can we generate musical notations from it?
- Can we create new learning patterns and art from it?

The djembe would be performed live by Ashok Kumar (http://jembeashok.com) and the code creation would be done by Amit Kapoor (http://amitkaps.com). For the technically inclined, we will leverage HTML canvas and Javascript Web Audio API using p5.js. But basically this is a fun talk to explore creative coding to learn new things.

# Notes on Talk

This is a fun talk in the intersection of - (live) music, data, visual and creative coding. The idea is to inspire people to find ways to think about visualisation more broadly in their own intersection of interest.

An earlier simpler version of this talk was done at javascript conference in India in 2015. You can see the talk and the material at http://djembeviz.amitkaps.com/ This would be a new version, building on the ideas of how we have seen people learning visually and also our own improved javascript coding skills.
