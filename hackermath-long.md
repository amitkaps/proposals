# HackerMath for Machine Learning

## Description
Machine Learning is a hard subject to start learning and demands  a robust of understanding of math, especially linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. However, the core concepts in machine learning - data transformations (projections), model abstraction  (cost function, gradient descent, regularisation) and model validation (bootstrapping, cross validation) - can be easily generalised to a few fundamental principles. In this talk, I will share how we can use simple python code to easily understand and visualise this generalisation in a *hacker's way* - to start our journey to develop mastery over the math by using code. 

## Who and Why (Audience)
If you are a python programmer and just starting your journey into learning from data, then the math behind machine learning can look overwhelming. This talks aims to provide a intuitive understanding on the core principles behind machine learning math using simple python code. After this talk, you will understand the core math concepts behind projections, cost functions, gradient descent, regularisation and validation that will help kick-start your learning journey.

## Outline

    - Data Transformation 
    - Model Abstraction
    - Model Validation
- **Data Transformations** (6 mins)
    - Make Lower Dimensional Projections
    - Or make Higher Dimensional Projections
- **Model Abstraction** (10 mins)
    - Build a Cost Function 
    - Minimise using Gradient Descent
    - Regularisation

    - Pointers for HackerMath Journey

A single example will be used across the talk to communicate this concept. The python code will be intuitive and simple and will use core numerical python libraries like numpy and core visualisation libraries like matplotlib.
