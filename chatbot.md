# Let's build a chatbot ! 

### Overview:
Chat Bots are the in-thing right now. Chris Messina (inventor of hashtag) called 2016 the year of conversational commerce. We could integrate bots with a host of applications - popular examples being Slack, Telegram and Facebook Messenger. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a deep learning powered chat bot. Pointers to scaling it up will also be discussed.


### Detailed Abstract:
This will be an applied tutorial (more hands-on than theory). By the end of the tutorial, the attendees will have enough knowledge and confidence to build a chat bot on their own.

The workshop will cover the following:

1. Introduction to Deep Learning
2. Challenges in Natural Language Processing
3. Introduction to RNN
4. Obtaining data from twitter
5. Training RNN to generate text
6. Generating text using Generative Adversarial Networks (time permitting)
7. Thoughts on how to scale the training process

We will be using Python data stack. The installation instructions will be available in the repo:

We will be using tensorflow (and keras) for the hands-on. 

We will be working on medium -sized dataset and will need a hardware with a minimum 8 GB RAM. Linux highly preferred (Though participants have had success running on Mac OS and Windows.). For the tutorial, GPU isn't required- though we will discuss how GPU impacts performance. 


### notes

The speakers have presented at a number of conferences.

A version of this tutorial was presented at Strata Singapore 2016. Slides can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/amitkaps/deep-learning-for-nlp-69972908)
