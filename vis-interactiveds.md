# Topic: Interactive Visualisation for Data Science

## Abstract

Visualization leverages the power of visual abstraction that humans are good at. One of the challenges in traditional data visualization is that they are static and have bounds on limited physical/pixel space. Interaction allows us to move beyond this limitation by adding the layers of interactions. This workshop helps you learn the art and science of crafting interactive data visualization.


## Detailed Description

_“A picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a thousand pictures.”_ – Ben Shneiderman

The ever increasing computational capacity has enabled us to acquire, process and analyze larger data-sets and information. However, the human memory and attention required to use this data is more limited and has remained relatively constant. Data visualisation can enable us to compress data and encode them in ways to aid perceptual, cognitive and emotional capacity required to comprehend, retain and make decisions using this data.

Visualisation leverage the power of the visual abstraction that humans are very good at. But one of the key challenge in traditional data visualisation is that they are static in nature and have the bounds of limited physical or pixel space. Interaction allows us to even move beyond this limitation and expand the scope of data visualisation by adding the layers of interactions.

We’ve all seen wonderful interactive data visualizations on the web (like those from the New York Times’s Upshot or FiveThirtyEight) and may want to bring similar interaction principles to our business dashboards. But crafting an interactive data visualization on the web is hard, especially if you have limited web programming background. More often than not, data scientists want to demonstrate/showcase their work as a dashboard, get approval from stakeholders before the dashboard is moved to production by front-end engineers.

The focus in this workshop will be to provide hands on experience on using simple tools on the browser (like visdown, polestar) to create interactive data visualization – both for conducting exploratory data analysis for large data sets and for communicating insights from data visually.

This workshop explains how to build interactive dashboards. You only need to learn the grammar and principles of interactive graphics, and you can then start your own journey in crafting interactive dashboards.

*Workshop Content*

**Grammar of interactive graphics: The four layers of abstraction**   

* Data layer: Data types and transformations    
* Visual layer: Variable mapping, marks, channels, scales, coordinate system, and layouts     
* Annotation layer: Titles, axes, legends, grids, references, and text       
* Interaction layer: Navigation, transition, selection, highlighting, filtering, brushing and linking, sorting, and animation      

**Tools landscape**

**Creating a static visualization**   

* Visualizing a multidimensional dataset     
* Playing with marks, channels, color, scales, and coordinates    
* Adding labeling and annotation     

**Adding an interaction layer**   

* Adding interactive data-model manipulation    
* Exploring common interaction patterns: Select, explore, reconfigure, encode, filter, and drill-down     

**Creating an interactive data visualization**    

**Building a full interactive data dashboard**
