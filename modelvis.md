# Visualizing Machine Learning Models

### Overview  

Even though data visualisation (data-vis) is an integral part of the data science pipeline and helps us understand the portrait of the data, we rarely leverage the power of visualisation for understanding machine learning (ML) models better. Even though data visualisation is an integral part of the data science pipeline and helps us understand the portrait of the data, we rarely leverage the power of visualisation for understanding machine learning models better.  In this talk, the speakers discuss how to visualize ML models to help data scientists and their stakeholders understand the model better and take appropriate decisions.


### Detailed Abstract

Model evaluation is still largely restricted through numerical summaries. Visualising Machine Learning Models(model-vis) can help us better understand - the shape of the model, the impact of parameter on the model, the impact of different input data on the model, the fit of the model and where it can be improved.

This talks will build up the grammar of model-vis for ML using real-life datasets with regression and classification problems. It would illustrate the key concepts in model-vis around the following blocks:- 

[0] Visualise the data space   
[1] Visualise the predictions in the data space  
[2] Visualise the errors in model fitting  
[3] Visualise the features in the model  
[4] Visualise with different model parameters  
[5] Visualise with different input datasets  
[6] Visualise the entire model space  
[7] Visualise the many models together   
It will also highlight the n/p/N challenges in conducting model-vis: large observations (n), high dimensionality (p) and model explosion (N)
