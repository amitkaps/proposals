# HackerMath for Machine Learning

## Description
Machine Learning is a hard subject to start learning and demands  a robust of understanding of math, especially linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. However, the core modelling concepts in machine learning - a model building (algorithm and weights, cost function, gradient descent), model tuning (regularisation, hyper-parameters) and model selection (cross validation) - can be easily generalised to a few fundamental principles. In this talk, I will share how we can use simple python and javascript code to easily **understand** and **visualise** the modelling process in a *hacker's way* - to start our journey to develop mastery over the math by using code.

## Who and Why (Audience)
If you are a python programmer and just starting your journey into learning from data, then the math behind machine learning can look overwhelming. This talks aims to provide a intuitive understanding on the core principles behind machine learning math using simple python code. After this talk, you will understand the core math concepts behind algorithm, weight, cost functions, gradient descent, regularisation and validation that will help kick-start your learning journey.

## Outline

- **Why HackerMath?** (5 mins)
    - Traditional way of understandting through Math (Symbolic Abstraction) 
    - Hacker's way of learning using Visualisation and Code  (Visual & Active Abstraction)
- **Machine Learning Process** (5 mins)
    - ML data: Features and Target 
    - ML model: An algorithm and its Weights/Parameters
    - ML process: Search for an Hypothesis Set
- **Model Building** (10 mins)
    - Choose an Algorithm
    - Build a Cost Function 
    - Minimise using Gradient Descent
- **Model Tuning** (10 mins)
    - Regularise the Model
    - Tune Model Hyper-Parameter  
- **Model Selecting** (5 mins)
    - Do Cross Validation
- **Generalisation** (5 mins)
    - Apply across ML Algorithms and 
    - Pointers for HackerMath Journey

The focus will be to illustrate the ML journey through visualisation and code using a single example of supervised learning. The data would be tabular and the algorithm family used will be Linear and Tree-based. The python and javascript code will be intuitive and simple and will use a few core libraries data loading, transformation, visualisation and machine learning,

- Data Loading and type inference (datalib.js & arrow.js in JS / Numpy & Pandas in Python)
- Visualisation (vega.js & vega-lite.js in JS / altair in Python)
- Machine Learning (ml.js & deeplearn.js in JS / scikit-learn in Python)

## Additional Notes

The speaker has been involved in doing analytics and visualisation for more than fifteen years and has been actively involved in teaching Data Visualisation and Data Science for the last seven years. 


He has been teaching HackerMath for Machine Learning over the last two years. You can browse through the workshop material at the Github repo - [https://github.com/amitkaps/hackermath](https://github.com/amitkaps/hackermath) which has received 1000+ stars on GitHub. The current repo material is in Python. A Javascript version and a long-form web version will be added shortly.
