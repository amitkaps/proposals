# Building Deep Learning Capabilities

This is a three step, 12 week plan to build deep learning skills within your organisation. The key components are:

1. **Applied Machine Learning**: Self Learning Approach (6 weeks)
2. **Deep Learning**: Workshop Learning Approach (1 week)
3. **Demo Day**: Project Learning Approach (5 weeks)

## 1. Applied Machine Learning

The objective for the Applied ML component is to ensure that the participants have prior experience of solving a business problem using machine learning. Without a strong Applied ML background, it is very hard for participants to successfully learn newer concepts of Deep Learning. All participants need to be familiar with the following key concepts and need to demonstrate they can apply them to a problem.

### **Key Applied ML Concept**
- **Theory**: ML Formulation, Generalisation, Bias-Variance, Overfitting
- **Paradigms**: Supervised - Regression & Classification, Unsupervised - Dimensionality Reduction
- **Models**: Linear Models, Tree Models, Perceptron Models
- **Methods**: Parameter Tuning, Regularisation, Validation, Aggregation
- **Process**: Frame, Acquire, Refine, Transform, Explore, Model, Communicate
- **Tools**: `git`, `jupiter`, `python`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`

### Approach

The primary approach for doing this would be provide all prospective participant a Machine Learning Case Problem case-study that they need to finish within a given time-frame (4 weeks) and submit their notebooks. These notebooks submission could form the basis of selection of participants for the second step - Deep Learning. The participants can form teams of maximum size 3.

In addition, we would do a half-day workshop session on Applied Machine Learning to address the gaps identified post the review process.

### Resources
Basic preparatory resource list would be shared with the participants including examples repositories like below:

- **The Art of Data Science** - [https://github.com/amitkaps/art-data-science](https://github.com/amitkaps/art-data-science)
- **Applied Machine Learning** - [https://github.com/amitkaps/applied-machine-learning](https://github.com/amitkaps/applied-machine-learning)

In addition, learning resources for all the tools - `git`, `jupiter`, `python`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`  would be shared with the participants.


## 2. Deep Learning

The objective for the Deep Learning component is to ensure that the participants have enough theory and practical concepts of building a deep learning solution in the space of image recognition. Post the workshop, all the participants would be familiar with the following key concepts and would be able to apply them to a problem.

### **Key Deep Learning Concept**
- **Theory**: DL Formulation, Back-propagation, Activation, Drop-outs
- **Paradigms**: End-to-End Learning, Transfer Learning, Reinforcement Learning
- **Models**: Pre-trained Models, Designing Model Architecture
- **Methods**: Convolution, Pooling, Residual
- **Process**: Setup, Encoding, Training, Serving
- **Tools**: `aws-setup`, `keras`, `tensorflow`,

### Approach
This would be a two-day instructor-led hands-on workshop to learn and implement an end-to-end deep learning model for computer vision (image recognition)

- Day 1 will cover introductory materials (Theory, Setup, Convolution, Pooling, Dropouts)
- Day 2 will cover advanced materials (Transfer Learning, GAN, Designing API)

There will be **eight** sessions in total of **two** hours each over the two days.

### Session 1: Theory
1. What is deep learning
2. Some use cases
3. A quick overview of the building blocks (neurons, activation functions, back propagation algorithm)
*This will be the only theoretical session in the entire workshop*

### Session 2: Building your first DL Model
1. Introduction to Problem
2. Setup - AWS, Tensorflow, Keras
3. Building the First DL Model

### Session 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Understanding Convolution
2. Understanding Max-pooling
3. Building a simple CNN model

### Session 4: Handling overfitting in Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Understanding Dropouts
2. Adding training data (rotations, etc)
3. Recap day 1, thoughts and feedback

### Session 5: Transfer Learning
1. Recap day 1
2. Understanding Transfer Learning
3. How to use pre-trained models to quickly build a prototype

### Session 6: Building an end-to-end AI system
1. Build API for the model
2. Client-side(UI) and server-side templates will be provided.
3. Participants should use that to ingest the data and throw out the predictions

### Session 7: Generative Adversarial Networks
1. Introduction to GAN
2. Image Generation using GAN

### Session 8: Residual Networks
1. Understanding Residual Networks
2. Conclusion: Recap of what we've accomplished in 2 days
3. Where to go from here and project road map

## Resources
The material for the workshop is hosted on github:
[https://github.com/rouseguy/DL_Image_Py](https://github.com/rouseguy/DL_Image_Py). This is from the popular workshop series by the speakers on deep learning. Addition materials relevant to learning Deep Learning would be shared prior to the workshop.


## 3. Demo Day

The objective for the Demo Day to ensure that the participants can demonstrate experience in building a problem solution in the space of image recognition.

### Approach
We will work with your team to create a problem statement on image recognition that every team would address. The participant teams would have 5 week to build a solution for the problem and demonstrate it on demo day. During the 5 weeks, there would in-person session and async communication to provide guidance and feedback to the teams.

### Resources
- Async communication using Slack for all participants
- Two in-person office hour session of 2 hours to allow the participants to get feedback and discuss issues.
- Demo-day for half-day where teams present their ideas.


## Commercials
- Applied Machine Learning
    - Problem Design and Participant Group Selection: INR 150,000
    - Half Day Workshop: INR 75,000

Service tax and other government charges as applicable will be additional. Also, for sessions conducted outside of Bangalore, the facilitatorâ€™s travel and accommodation cost would be charged on actuals.

In addition, maximum number of groups for selection would be capped at 30 groups (of upto 3 participants each). Further, maximum number of participants for the in-person workshops would be capped to 50.

All infrastructure for conducting the in-person workshops, meeting space as well as AWS credits for the training would need to be provided directly by the company.
