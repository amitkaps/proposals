# Improving trainee performance in online coaching using Active Learning

### Overview 

We have seen tremendous attrition or slacking off after initial engagement with smart(ML-driven) online coaching platforms/apps - be it for education or health. In this talk, you will understand how to leverage signals from the users real-time to design a human-in-the-loop ML system for online coaching. From our experience, these systems resulted in superior engagement and improved performance.

### Abstract

We have seen a lot of people drop out or slack off after the initial engagement with online coaching platforms/apps – be in health-based training or educational training. This is inspite of the applications having a smart recommendation system in place.

The challenges: The application hasn’t been able to engage the user using the signals obtained real-time. Particularly, the choices the users are making when engaging with the system provide a lot of cue that generally get lost.

But what if the application probes and pushes the user – and uses that data to dynamically update the ML component and use that to provide a richer engagement?

That’s the crux of Active Learning.

Machines are rational, compute very fast and scale well. But they need lot of data to build an intelligent system. The issue? It is not always easy and cheap to get labeled data to build efficient ML systems.

On the other hand, humans learn quickly with small amount of data. Intuition provides us a mechanism to learn and act fast in a new setting. But humans are emotional. And biased.

Active Learning harnesses the best of both worlds.

This talk shows how active learning was used to provide richer engagement for the user through active learning and how that resulted in superior performance.

An overview of how the ML pipeline along with the human component was setup will be discussed, along with some of the challenges faced along the way.
