# Flatlands: 2D Visualisation of Multi-Dimensional Data

## Description 

Even though exploring data visually is an integral part of the data analytic pipeline, we struggle to visually explore data once the number of dimensions go beyond three. This talk will focus on showcasing techniques to visually explore multi dimensional data (p > 4) through both representation and projection based approach by visualising it in two dimensions. The aim would be show examples of the possible techniques to navigate this flatlands, using one exemplar dataset. 


## Outline

- Visualising Multi-Dimensional Data (5 mins)
  - The Curse of Dimensionality
  - Representations and Projections
  - Trade-offs in moving to Flatlands
  
- Representation Approaches (10 mins)
  - Aggregation: TableLens
  - Small Multiples: Facets 
  - Alternate Coordinates: Parallel
  - Pixel based: Space Filling Curves
  - Stacked based: Hierarchical

- Projection Approaches (10 mins)
  - Linear Transformation: PCA
  - Optimization Based: t-SNE
  - Manifold Based: IsoMap
  - Graph based: Nearest Neighbour
  - Neural Nets: Auto-encoder

- Navigating Flatlands (5 mins)
  - Using Interaction to aid discovery
  - Guidance on choosing the right method

## Audience

The talk is ideal for those using Python for Data Analysis and Machine Learning and want to understand and learn how to visualise multi-dimensional data. They should have some basic experience with simple visualisation of 2 -3 dimensional data. Post the talk, the will have a richer understanding of the approach to take for visualising multi-dimensional data in their own domain.  


## Additional 

The speaker has been involved in doing analytics and visualisation for more than fifteen years and has been actively involved in teaching Data Visualisation and Data Science for the last seven years.
