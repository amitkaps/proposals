The objective for the Deep Learning 101 (introduction to deep learning) is to ensure that the participants have enough theory and practical concepts of building a deep learning solution.Post the session, all the participants would be familiar with many of the  key concepts and would be able to build simple deep learning models.

### Key Concepts

**Theory**: DL Motivation, Back-propagation, Activation
**Paradigms**: Supervised
**Models**: Architecture, Pre-trained Models (Transfer Learning)
**Methods**: Perceptron, Convolution, Pooling, Dropouts
**Process**: Setup, Encoding, Training, Serving
**Tools**: python-data-stack, keras

### Approach

This would be a half-day instructor-led hands-on workshop to learn and implement an end-to-end deep learning model for classification.

### Session Breakdown

**Deep Learning (DL) Theory** 

1. What is deep learning?
2. Use cases in computer vision and natural language processing
3. Overview of the building blocks
4. Neurons
5. Activation functions
6. Back propagation algorithm
7. Stochastic gradient descent
8. MLP
9. CNN
10. Transfer learning

**Hands-on**

1. Introduction to `keras`
2. Overview of the cloud setup 
3. Introduction to the problem
4. Build first model - MLP
5. Build second model - CNN
6. Build third model - transfer learning

### Resources

The material for the workshop is hosted on github:

For Image: https://github.com/rouseguy/DeepLearning-Image
For NLP: https://github.com/rouseguy/DeepLearning-NLP
This is from the popular workshop series by the speakers on deep learning. Additional materials relevant to learning Deep Learning would be shared prior to the workshop.

### Target Audience

Anyone interested in understanding ML/AI/DL

### Pre-requisites

Exposure to basic programming paradigms is ideal. It is preferred that participants brush up a bit of Python before attending the session.

### Software Requirements

We will be using a cloud service. No software setup needed. Please get a laptop for the workshop.
